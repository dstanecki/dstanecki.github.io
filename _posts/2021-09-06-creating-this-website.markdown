This is my first blog website. It took some trial and error, but I managed to get it up and running. I used GitHub Pages and Jekyll to create the site, and I used namecheap.com to obtain the domain. The grand total to run the site came out to only $9/year, which I was very happy with. [This tutorial](https://devblast.com/b/create-a-static-websiteblog-with-jekyll-and-github-pages) was extremely helpful and easy to follow for a first-time Jekyll user.
