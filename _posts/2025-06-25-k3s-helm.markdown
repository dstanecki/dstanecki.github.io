Now that I'd created two types of deployment YAMLs--single node and double node--it was time to package and segment them into Helm charts.<!--break-->

#### **Installing Helm on K3s**

Important to note that k3s stores the kubeconfig file at /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml and not the traditional ~/.kube/config because they figured that installing the cluster system-wide was more simple than installing it under a user. So we need to export kubeconfig variable:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml

# Persist on reboot, note >> appends to the end of file and > would overwrite it
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml >> ~/.bashrc 
```

#### **Final Thoughts**
