A step-by-step guide to serving a Kubernetes app over HTTPS using Traefik, cert-manager, and Cloudflare Tunnel â€” **without a public IP**, on bare metal Raspberry Pis.

When I moved into my new apartment, I brought my Raspberry Pi K8s cluster with me, planning to expose it publicly. Except I missed one small detail: the apartment didn't have a coaxial outlet for traditional internet. I had to get a wireless 5G router which uses **CGNAT (Carrier-Grade NAT)** -- a method used by ISPs to conserve public IPv4 addresses by having multiple customers share a single public IP. You can't assign a public IP to your load balancer if you don't have your own to begin with. That wrecked my plan to expose my app via MetalLB and Traefik. Here's how I worked around it.<!--break-->

### **What Doesn't Work**

I racked my brain for workarounds. Public IPv6 address? Nope -- not allowed with this 5G wireless router. Set up a site-to-site VPN to a cloud provider and use a cloud load balancer? Maybe, but I wanted to keep everything bare-metal and easily reproducible. Not only that, but my primary motivation for doing this project on Raspberry Pis was to avoid ongoing costs of cloud infrastructure.

I had already been using a [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) private mesh network to connect my Raspberry Pis with my laptop, since I like to SSH to them remotely if I need to. This was actually a lifesaver for me, since I was using PiVPN (OpenVPN) with my old router which allowed port forwarding, but of course this new wireless 5G router does not. **While Tailscale does offer a service called Funnel, which can expose your private service to the internet, it restricts you to using a subdomain.ts.net and is not compatible with CNAME.** I found this out the hard way when my CNAME setup kept throwing an SSL error for no apparent reason. Funnel is still in Beta, so limitations like this aren't clearly documented yet.

Luckily, there are two other services that allow you to get past CGNAT restrictions **and** let you use your own domain name: Ngrok and CloudFlare Tunnel.

### **Ngrok vs CloudFlare Tunnel**

**CNAME Support**
- CloudFlare Tunnel is free and supports custom CNAME records (as long as you delegate your domain to their nameservers)
- Ngrok has a free-tier but custom CNAME support will run you about $10/month (but no domain transfer required)

**TLS Certificate Options**
- Ngrok requires paid plan for both Ngrok-managed certs for your CNAME and for using self-managed certs (e.g. LetsEncrypt) to achieve TLS passthrough
- CloudFlare will let you manage your own cert in the Free Tier. (Optionally you can pay for a managed cert)

**End-to-End TLS Encryption**
- Ngrok supports end-to-end encryption if you configure it that way
- CloudFlare Tunnel doesn't support true end-to-end encryption and terminates TLS at their servers (I guess this is how they turn a profit, they offer certain features for free in exchange for our data)

**Security Features**
- CloudFlare Tunnel has built-in DDoS protection and web application firewall for free
- Ngrok does not

#### **FINAL VERDICT**
For my use case, I would prefer to stay free tier and I also want CNAME support, so I'm going to choose **CloudFlare Tunnel**. I'll have to delegate my Route 53 domain to CloudFlare. I'm also going to generate my own TLS cert with cert-manager + LetsEncrypt for the cost savings. Due to the limitations of CGNAT and the nature of CloudFlare Tunnel, I will be using a DNS-01 challenge instead of HTTP-01.

# **Steps**

#### Architecture of Let's Encrypt + Traefik Reverse Proxy + Cloudflare Tunnel setup
![/assets/k8s-ingress-letsencrypt.drawio.png](/assets/k8s-ingress-letsencrypt.drawio.png)
 
Prerequisites: 
- An existing K8s web app with a frontend service
- Traefik
- cert-manager (kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.18.0/cert-manager.yaml)
- CloudFlare account
- Domain name (mine is in AWS Route 53)

1. Install the cloudflared agent and follow tunnel setup instructions from the [docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/). You can specify the number of replicas, ensure that you have enough across different nodes for HA -- ideally using antiAffinity rules. 

{:start="2"}
2. Associate your domain with the tunnel and make sure that your domain nameservers are delegated to CloudFlare's servers. Point your CNAME record to TUNNEL_ID.cfargotunnel.com 

{:start="3"}
3. Internal app-service needs to be ClusterIP (as opposed to NodePort which is what I was using to expose my app internally)

{:start="4"}
4. Create a Route 53 service account with proper IAM permissions (will be used for the DNS-01 Challenge)

{:start="5"}
5. Copy the access keys and create a kubectl secret 

  ```bash
  kubectl create secret generic route53-credentials-secret \
    --from-literal=access-key-id=<ACCESS-KEY> \
    --from-literal=secret-access-key=<SECRET-ACCESS-KEY> \
    --namespace cert-manager
  ```

{:start="6"}  
6. Create a ClusterIssuer

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
  kind: ClusterIssuer
  metadata:
    name: letsencrypt-prod
  spec:
    acme:
      email: <YOUR_EMAIL>
      server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
      privateKeySecretRef:
        name: letsencrypt-prod
      solvers:
      - dns01:
          route53:
            region: us-east-1
            hostedZoneID: <HOSTED ZONE ID>
            accessKeyIDSecretRef:
              name: route53-credentials-secret
              key: access-key-id
            secretAccessKeySecretRef:
              name: route53-credentials-secret
              key: secret-access-key
  ```

{:start="7"}
7. Create a Certificate Object (default duration is 90d, cert-manager will auto-renew after 60d)

  ```yaml 
  apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
  kind: Certificate
  metadata:
    name: zhf-tls
    namespace: default
  spec:
    secretName: zhf-tls
    issuerRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
      kind: ClusterIssuer
    commonName: zhf.danielstanecki.com
    dnsNames:
      - zhf.danielstanecki.com
  ```

{:start="8"}
8. Create an Ingress with websecure entrypoint and reference the Certificate

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Ingress
  metadata:
    name: zhf-tls-ingress
    annotations:
      traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.entrypoints: websecure
      # You would use below annotation with a Traefik Middleware object if you couldn't enforce HTTPS redirection from DNS level (like I am with CloudFlare)
      # traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.middlewares: redirect-https@kubernetescrd
  spec:
    ingressClassName: traefik
    rules:
      - host: zhf.danielstanecki.com
        http:
          paths:
            - path: /
              pathType: Prefix
              backend:
                service:
                  name: app
                  port:
                    number: 5000
    tls:
      - secretName: zhf-tls
        hosts:
          - zhf.danielstanecki.com
```

{:start="9"}
9. Apply the objects and the cert will be issued automatically and begin DNS-01 Challenge which can take a few minutes. 

  ```bash
  watch kubectl get challenges -n kube-system
  ```

{:start="10"}
10. Configure CloudFlare Tunnel
- Point your domain to https://traefik.default.svc.cluster.local:443 (if in default namespace)
- Specify Origin Server Name, NO TLS Verify, enable HTTP2 since that's fully supported by Traefik
- Enforce "Always Use HTTPS"

{:start="11"}
11. If done right, your web application will serve over HTTPS only.
