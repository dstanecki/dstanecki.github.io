My name is Daniel Stanecki and I'm a Chicago-based DevOps Engineer specializing in CI/CD, site reliability, and all things automation. I enjoy writing infrastructure-as-code and deep diving into Kubernetes on my home Raspberry Pi cluster. I started this blog as a way to share my projects and to look back on the progress I've made over the years. I also like to document the problems I encounter for future reference. 

Check out my GitHub to see what I've been working on lately: [https://github.com/dstanecki](https://github.com/dstanecki)
