My name is Daniel Stanecki and I'm a 4th year IT student living in Chicago. I started this blog website as a way to share my personal projects and resources that I find to be interesting or useful. For me, writing about what I'm learning, in my own words, helps my learning process monumentally. Hopefully I can help others too.
