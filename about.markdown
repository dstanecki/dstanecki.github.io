My name is Daniel Stanecki and I'm a 4th year IT student living in Chicago. I started this blog website as a way to share my personal projects and resources that I find to be interesting or useful. Blogging about my projects helps my learning process, and as such I will mainly be posting material that I find especially relevant to my career development.
