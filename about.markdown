My name is Daniel Stanecki and I'm a 4th year IT student living in Chicago. I started this blog website as a way to share my personal projects and resources that I find to be interesting or useful. I picked up an interest in IT when I got my first PC many years ago, which I used for gaming and content creating at the time. I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out what exactly I want to do in the field, and it wasn't until after I started tinkering with cloud technologies that I took up an interest in solution architecture. 

In my day to day life I am always heavily weighing the pros and cons of my decisions, big and small, always seeking the best bang for my buck. Naturally, this attracted me to learning about the cloud, due to its potential for optimizing costs and time requirements. As of late I've been studying AWS cloud infrastructure, automation, programming, and security.
